# Revision history for butcher

## 2.0.0.0  -- May 2023

Large internal refactor including some breaking API changes.

- Support ghc-9.0 and ghc-9.2
- Add the "Applicative" interface in addition to the existing "Monadic" one.
  This is slightly less expressive but conceptually cleaner/safer (and its
  implementation is nicer). For best readability you may need `ApplicativeDo`.
- The applicative interface is *NOT* finished and the test-suite does not
  cover it.
- Add the `traverseBarbie` construct to elegantly define a parser for a
  config data-structure.\
  Introduces a dependency on the `barbies` library.
- Refactor the module structure a bit, and change the API of the central
  `runCmdParser` function. It now returns a `PartialParseInfo`. Essentially,
  `runCmdParser` is a combination of the previous `runCmdParser` and the
  previous `simpleCompletion`. This API design is a curious advantage to
  laziness: Returning a complex struct is harmless as fields that the user
  does not use won't be evaluated. The downside is that the core function now
  looks like a complex beast, but the upside is that there is no need to
  expose multiple functions that are supposed to be chained in a certain way
  to get all functionality (if desired), and we still _can_ provide simpler
  versions that are just projections on the `PartialParseInfo`.
- Remove deprecated functions
- `peekCmdDesc` is now guaranteed to yield the proper full `CmdDesc` value
  for the current command or child-command.
- Remove the `mainFromCmdParserWithHelpDesc` function, because it is redundant
  given the new semantics of `peekCmdDesc`.
- Stop support for an anti-feature: The implicit merging of multiple
  sub-commands definitions with the same name.
- Internal refactor: The monadic interface now uses two-phase setup: First step
  is to create a full CommandDesc value, second is running the parser on input
  while the CommandDesc is chained along
